# Perceptr0n

**Has been ported to [dolphnet](https://github.com/Dolpheyn/dolphnet)**

A perceptron with parameters:

THETA(θ) - Treshold value

ALPHA(ɑ) - Learning rate

> It currently takes only 0 vector as the weight instead of a random one (as
per my ML uni slide)

## Sample outputs

1. [OR operator - Binary Input, Bipolar Target](OR.md)
2. [AND operator - Binary Input, Bipolar Target](AND.md)

## Example usage (send to clipboard and render to md)

```bash
python3 main.py > xclip -selection c
```

Paste in [dillinger](https://dillinger.io/)
